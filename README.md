# Notif2MQTT

A lightweight native Android app that captures all device notifications and sends them to an MQTT server.

## Features

- ✨ **Native & Lightweight**: Pure Kotlin with Android SDK
- 🔔 **Notification Capture**: Captures all system notifications
- 📡 **MQTT Client**: Real-time sending to MQTT broker with SSL/TLS support
- 🔒 **Secure Connections**: Support for encrypted MQTT connections (`ssl://`)
- 🚫 **App Exclusions**: Filter specific applications
- ⚡ **Background Service**: Continuous operation
- 🔋 **Optimized**: Minimal battery consumption
- 🎯 **Importance Levels**: Captures notification importance

## Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- Network connection

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Notif2MQTT

# Build APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Configuration

### 1. Configure MQTT Broker

In the app, configure:

- **Broker URL**: `tcp://IP:PORT` for unencrypted or `ssl://IP:PORT` for encrypted connections
  - Examples: `tcp://192.168.1.100:1883` (unencrypted) or `ssl://192.168.1.100:8883` (encrypted)
- **Username/Password**: (Optional) Broker credentials

### 2. Grant Permissions

The app requires notification access:

1. Open the app
2. Tap "Open Settings" in the permissions section
3. Enable "Notif2MQTT" in the notification services list

### 3. Exclude Apps (Optional)

In the "App Exclusions" section, select apps whose notifications you don't want to send.

### 4. Disable Battery Optimization

For continuous operation:

1. Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Optimization
2. Find "Notif2MQTT"
3. Select "Don't optimize"

## MQTT Message Format

Notifications are sent in JSON format:

```json
{
  "package": "com.whatsapp",
  "app": "WhatsApp",
  "title": "New message",
  "text": "Hello, how are you?",
  "timestamp": 1703001234567,
  "icon": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAABACA...",
  "importance": 4,
  "category": "msg"
}
```

### Importance

The `importance` field is the effective Android importance of the notification (0-5), as
ranked by the system (it reflects the user's channel settings). Consumers derive
their own priority from `importance` and `category`.

### Notification Categories

The `category` field contains the Android notification category (if available):

- **msg**: Message notifications
- **email**: Email notifications
- **call**: Incoming call
- **alarm**: Alarm or timer
- **social**: Social network notifications
- **promo**: Promotional notifications
- **event**: Calendar events
- **transport**: Travel/transportation updates

## Consuming Notifications

Notif2MQTT sends notifications to an MQTT broker in JSON format. You can consume these notifications using any MQTT client.

### MQTT Broker Setup

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

### Linux Desktop Integration

For displaying notifications on Linux desktop, check out **[mqtt2notif](https://github.com/vpont/mqtt2notif)** - a companion Python daemon that receives MQTT notifications and displays them using libnotify.

## Troubleshooting

### App doesn't capture notifications

- Verify notification access permission is granted
- Restart the application
- Check Settings > Apps > Notif2MQTT for active permissions

### App can't connect to MQTT broker

- Verify broker URL is correct (must include `tcp://` for unencrypted or `ssl://` for encrypted connections)
- For SSL connections, ensure the broker uses a valid certificate or self-signed certificates are accepted
- Ensure Android device is on the same network as the broker
- Verify port is open (default 1883 for TCP, 8883 for SSL)
- Check credentials if broker requires authentication

### Service stops

- Disable battery optimization for the app
- Some manufacturers (Xiaomi, Huawei) have additional restrictions in Settings > Battery > App Permissions

### Not receiving all notifications

- Some apps don't allow their notifications to be read for security reasons
- Verify the app is not in the exclusion list

## Dependencies

- Eclipse Paho MQTT Client (1.2.5) with SSL/TLS support
- AndroidX Core, AppCompat, Material Design
- RecyclerView
